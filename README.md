# Design a Parking Lot

## Problem Statement
A parking lot is an area where cars can be parked for a certain amount of time. A parking lot can have multiple floors with each floor having a different number of slots and each slot being suitable for different types of vehicles. 
For this problem, we have to design the next-generation parking lot system that can manage a parking lot without any human intervention 

## Requirements
